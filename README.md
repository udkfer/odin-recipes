# Odin Recipes

This project is a simple website for the TOP Project: Recipes. It is a website that contains a list of recipes, each with its own page.

## Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The main page of the website, containing links to all the recipes.
- `recipes/`: A directory containing individual HTML files for each recipe. Currently, we have the following recipes:
  - `chop.html`: A simple yet delicious chop recipe.
  - `lemonade.html`: An easy and refreshing lemonade recipe.
  - `creamsago.html`: A creamy and flavorful Red Wine Sago with Cream dessert recipe.
- `images/`: A directory containing images for each recipe.
